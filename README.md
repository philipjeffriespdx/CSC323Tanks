Hello Dr. Mood,

For my special item I created a bomb that the players can run into.  I ran into some troubles with being able to populate the bombs each
round, and with playing an audio clip along with it (I thought it would be the same as the bullet prefab).  Other than that it works
great!

Thanks,

Philip Jeffries
